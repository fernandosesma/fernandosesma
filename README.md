# Fernando Sesma
New software developer trying to make it all work!

Current: Software Engineer @[Dell Technologies](https://github.com/dell)

## About Me
I am a software engineer in my first full-time position (and still learning a lot!) My current job involves creating Spring based microservices in Java for deployment in the cloud. Furthermore, I'm a big fan of front-end design development—with primary interests in web development and scraping, API design, and video game development. With a primary background in aerospace engineering, software development has been a fascinating journey that I look forward to continuing! I hope you enjoyed reading this blurb and that my GitHub repos may aid you in YOUR software journey.
